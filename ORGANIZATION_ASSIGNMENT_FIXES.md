# Organization Assignment and Authentication Fixes

## Overview

Fixed organization assignment for new entities and authentication issues throughout the admin interface.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Organization Assignment for New Entities

**Problem**: When adding new users, batches, classes, courses, instructors, or students, they weren't being assigned to the current admin's organization.

**Solution**:

- ✅ Backend routes already properly handle organization assignment through middleware
- ✅ Frontend components now use proper authentication headers
- ✅ Components now refetch data after adding instead of manually updating state

### 2. Authentication Headers Missing

**Problem**: Frontend components were missing authentication headers, causing 401 errors after adding entities.

**Solution**: Added `getAuthHeaders()` function calls to all add/import operations:

#### Frontend Components Fixed:

- `Users.tsx` - Add user functionality now refetches with auth
- `Batches.tsx` - Add/import batches with auth headers
- `Classes.tsx` - Add/import classes with auth headers
- `Courses.tsx` - Add/import courses with auth headers
- `Instructors.tsx` - Add/import instructors with auth headers
- `Students.tsx` - Add/import students with auth headers

#### Backend Routes Fixed:

- `classes.js` - Added auth middleware to bulk routes
- `students.js` - Added auth middleware to bulk routes
- `questions.js` - Added auth middleware to upload route

### 3. Question Bank Issues

**Problem**:

- API endpoint URL was incorrect (`/api/questions/questions` → `/api/questions`)
- Create/edit question functionality missing authentication headers
- Upload image functionality missing authentication

**Solution**:

- ✅ Fixed API endpoint URL in `fetchQuestions()`
- ✅ Added authentication headers to `addQuestion()`, `updateQuestion()`, `uploadImage()`
- ✅ Added authentication middleware to backend upload route
- ✅ Added proper 401 error handling

## Authentication Pattern Applied

All components now use this standard pattern:

```javascript
// Get auth headers
const getAuthHeaders = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  return {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  };
};

// API call with auth headers
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/endpoint`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: getAuthHeaders(),
  body: JSON.stringify(data),
});
```

## Organization Assignment Flow

1. **User creates new entity** (user, batch, class, course, instructor, student)
2. **Frontend sends request** with authentication headers
3. **Backend middleware** (`addOrganizationFilter`) extracts user's organization
4. **Backend assigns** `organization_id` to new entity
5. **Frontend refetches** data to show updated list with proper filtering

## Security Improvements

- ✅ **Complete Data Isolation**: Each organization's data is isolated
- ✅ **Automatic Organization Assignment**: All new entities inherit creator's organization
- ✅ **Proper Authentication**: All API requests require valid JWT tokens
- ✅ **Role-Based Authorization**: Different access levels based on user roles
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Proper handling of authentication errors

## Backend Middleware Applied

All critical routes now have proper middleware chain:

```javascript
router.post(
  "/bulk",
  authenticateToken,
  requireRole("admin", "super_admin"),
  addOrganizationFilter(),
  async (req, res) => {
    const orgFilter = req.getOrgFilter();
    const organization_id = orgFilter.hasFilter
      ? orgFilter.organizationId
      : null;
    // ... create entity with organization_id
  }
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Organization Admin**: Should only see their organization's data
2. **Super Admin**: Should see all data from all organizations
3. **Create Entities**: Should automatically inherit creator's organization
4. **Authentication**: Should handle token expiration gracefully
5. **Question Bank**: Should load and allow creating/editing questions
