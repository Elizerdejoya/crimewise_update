## Authentication Pattern Applied

All frontend components now use this standard pattern:

```javascript
// Get current user from localStorage
const getCurrentUser = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (!token) return null;
  try {
    const payload = JSON.parse(atob(token.split(".")[1]));
    return payload;
  } catch (e) {
    return null;
  }
};

// Create auth headers
const getAuthHeaders = () => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  return {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  };
};

// API call with auth headers
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/endpoint`, {
  cache: "no-store",
  headers: getAuthHeaders(),
}).then((res) => {
  if (res.status === 401) {
    toast({
      title: "Authentication Error",
      description: "Please log in again.",
      variant: "destructive",
    });
    return;
  }
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${res.status}`);
  }
  return res.json();
});
```

## Organization-Based Access Control

All routes now properly implement organization-based access control:

- **Super Admins** (`super_admin`): Can access all data across all organizations
- **Organization Admins** (`admin`): Can only access data from their own organization
- **Instructors/Students**: Can only access data from their own organization with role-specific restrictions

## Instructor-Specific Features

### Backend Question Filtering

- **Instructors**: Can only see questions they created (`q.created_by = user_id`)
- **Admins**: Can see all questions in their organization
- **Super Admins**: Can see all questions across all organizations

### Database Schema Corrections

- Fixed question column references from `q.instructor_id` to `q.created_by`
- Ensured proper foreign key relationships for organization-based filtering

### Exam Creation Workflow

- Instructors can only create exams with their own questions
- All related entities (courses, classes, questions) must belong to the same organization
- Backend validates organization membership for all exam components

## Subscription-Based Access Control

### Student Exam Access Restrictions

- **Subscription Validation**: Students can only access/submit exams if their organization's subscription is active and not expired
- **Real-time Checks**: Both exam access (GET `/token/:token`) and submission (POST `/submit`) validate subscription status
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when subscription has expired
- **Organization Boundaries**: Students can only access exams from instructors in their organization

### Enhanced Score Display

- **Score Format**: All exam results now show "score/total (percentage%)" format instead of just raw scores
- **PDF Export**: Score formatting applied to both on-screen display and PDF exports
- **Percentage Calculation**: Automatic percentage calculation based on total possible points
- **Consistent Display**: Same format used in exam results table and detailed view popups

## Security Improvements

1. **Complete Data Isolation**: Each organization's data is completely isolated
2. **Proper Authentication**: All API requests require valid JWT tokens
3. **Role-Based Authorization**: Different access levels based on user roles
4. **Error Handling**: Proper handling of authentication errors with user feedback
5. **Organization Filtering**: Backend automatically filters data based on user's organization
6. **Instructor Restrictions**: Instructors can only access their own created questions and related data
7. **Subscription Enforcement**: Students can only access exams when their organization's subscription is active
8. **Enhanced Score Display**: Exam results show comprehensive score/total (percentage%) format

## Testing Recommendations

After these fixes, test the following scenarios:

1. **Organization Admin Login**: Should only see their organization's data
2. **Super Admin Login**: Should see all data from all organizations
3. **Token Expiration**: Should show proper error messages and redirect to login
4. **Cross-Organization Access**: Should be prevented at the backend level
5. **API Endpoints**: All should now return proper data without 401 errors
6. **Student Exam Access**: Students should only access exams when subscription is active
7. **Score Display**: Exam results should show score/total (percentage%) format
8. **Student Navigation**: AI Assistant should not appear in student sidebar
9. **Instructor Dashboard**: All API calls should work without 401 errors
10. **Student Exam Flow**: Students should be able to enter exam tokens, take exams, and view results without authentication errors

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Frontend components gracefully handle authentication errors
- Backend routes enforce organization boundaries
- Proper error messages guide users when authentication fails
